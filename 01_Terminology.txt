Control plane:
    Scheduler
    API Server: listen for commands
    Controller: check the yml files and make sure thaty the desired state match the actual state

Pod: a workload we want to deploy to k8
     can be multiple tasks
     a Pod ahs name, labels and annotations (other metadata)

Container: a process running in the pod
           a container can have env variables, ports, resources (cpu, memory)
           k8 will throttle pods that use higher cpu and kill pods that use over the memory limit

           liveness probe: pods are live and restart the pod if the liveness probe is not meet
           readiness probe: tells to k8 when the pods is ready to take traffic
           startup probe: executed on start

           volumes: mount storage to container
                    can be configurations or secrets
        
Configmaps: configuration files that can be mapped to env variables
            can use kubectl create configmap to inject local config files into the pod 
            
Secrets: store files, tls certificates or key-value pairs 
         can use kubectl create secret to inject local config files into the pod 
         there are different types of secret


Run pods:

    As cronjobs:   schedule on specifig interval
    As deployment: continues running with number of replicas (can change nodes)
    As statefulsets: continues running with number of replicas on specific nodes

Storage class: 
        an abstract of dynamically attached storage
        They are defined at cluster level

Deamonset: run on every node (log collector, monitoring agents)


Services: how to refer to pods (name because ip might change when pod killed)
        a service has a name and label selector to map the pods
        the service bind a port to pod port
        When i have multiple pods for an app then i use service to load balance the workload
        Type of services:
            ClusterIP: private communication
            externalname: 
            Load balancer: public communication
            Nodeport: pod can be accessed with the public ip and port of the node 

Ingress: define how to accept traffic
         Usually the apps in k8 are deployied privatly and we use INGRESS to expose them publibly
         host, url, service

Controllers: are pods that run in a controlled loop
             monitor the state based on yml files

Namespace: group pods to control access
